Usage
=====

.. code-block:: django

    {% load compress %}
    {% compress <js/css> [<file/infile>] %}
    <html of inline or linked JS/CSS>
    {% endcompress %}

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: django

    {% load compress %}

    {% compress css %}
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/one.css" type="text/css" charset="utf-8">
    <style type="text/css">p { border:5px solid green;}</style>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/two.css" type="text/css" charset="utf-8">
    {% endcompress %}

Which would be rendered something like:

.. code-block:: django

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/CACHE/css/f7c661b7a124.css" type="text/css" charset="utf-8">

or:

.. code-block:: django

    {% load compress %}

    {% compress js %}
    <script src="/static/js/one.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">obj.value = "value";</script>
    {% endcompress %}

Which would be rendered something like:

.. code-block:: django

    <script type="text/javascript" src="/static/CACHE/js/3f33b9146e12.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Linked files **must** be accesible via :ref:`COMPRESS_URL <compress_url>`.

If the :ref:`COMPRESS <compress>` setting is ``False`` (defaults to the
opposite of DEBUG) the ``compress`` template tag does nothing and simply returns
exactly what it was given.

If both DEBUG and :ref:`COMPRESS <compress>` are set to ``True``, uncompressable
files (off-site or non existent) will throw and exception. If DEBUG is ``False``
these files will be silently stripped.

.. warning::

    For production sites it is **strongly recommended** to use a real cache
    backend such as memcached_ to speed up the checks of compressed files.
    Make sure you set your Django cache backend appropriately (also see
    :ref:`COMPRESS_CACHE_BACKEND <compress_cache_backend>` and
    Django's `caching documentation`_).

The compress template tag supports a second arguemnt specifying the output
mode and defaults to saving the result in a file. Alternatively you can
pass '``inline``' to the template tag to return the content directly to the
rendered page, e.g.:

.. code-block:: django

    {% load compress %}

    {% compress js inline %}
    <script src="/static/js/one.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">obj.value = "value";</script>
    {% endcompress %}

would be rendered something like::

    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
    obj = {};
    obj.value = "value";
    </script>

.. _pre-compression:

Pre-compression
---------------

Django Compressor comes with an optional ``compress`` mangement command to
run the compression outside of the request/response loop -- independent
from user requests. This allows to pre-compress CSS and JavaScript files and
works just like the automatic compression with the ``{% compress %}`` tag.

To compress the files "offline" and update the offline cache you have
to use the ``compress`` management command, ideally during deployment.
Also make sure to enable the :ref:`COMPRESS_OFFLINE <compress_offline>`
setting. In case you don't use the ``compress`` management command, Django
Compressor will automatically fallback to the automatic compression using
the template tag.

The command parses all templates that can be found with the template
loader (as specified in the TEMPLATE_LOADERS_ setting) and looks for
``{% compress %}`` blocks. It then will use the context as defined in
:ref:`COMPRESS_OFFLINE_CONTEXT <compress_offline_context>` to render its
content. So if you use any variables inside the ``{% compress %}`` blocks,
make sure to list all values you require in ``COMPRESS_OFFLINE_CONTEXT``.
It's similar to a template context and should be used if a variable is used
in the blocks, e.g.:

.. code-block:: django

    {% load compress %}
    {% compress js %}
    <script src="{{ path_to_files }}js/one.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
    {% endcompress %}

Since this template requires a variable (``path_to_files``) you need to
specify this in your settings before using the ``compress`` management
command::

    COMPRESS_OFFLINE_CONTEXT = {
        'path_to_files': '/static/js/',
    }

If not specified, the ``COMPRESS_OFFLINE_CONTEXT`` will by default contain
the commonly used setting to refer to saved files ``MEDIA_URL`` and
``STATIC_URL`` (if specified in the settings).

The result of running the ``compress`` management command will be saved
in the cache defined in :ref:`COMPRESS_CACHE_BACKEND <compress_cache_backend>`
for the number of seconds defined in the
:ref:`COMPRESS_OFFLINE_TIMEOUT <compress_offline_timeout>` setting.

CSS Notes
---------

All relative ``url()`` bits specified in linked CSS files are automatically
converted to absolute URLs while being processed. Any local absolute URLs (those
starting with a ``'/'``) are left alone.

Stylesheets that are ``@import``'d are not compressed into the main file.
They are left alone.

If the media attribute is set on <style> and <link> elements, a separate
compressed file is created and linked for each media value you specified.
This allows the media attribute to remain on the generated link element,
instead of wrapping your CSS with @media blocks (which can break your own
@media queries or @font-face declarations). It also allows browsers to avoid
downloading CSS for irrelevant media types.

Recommendations
---------------

* Use only relative or full domain absolute URLs in your CSS files.
* Avoid @import! Simply list all your CSS files in the HTML, they'll be combined anyway.
