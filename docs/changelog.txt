0.6.1
-----

- Fixed staticfiles support to also use its finder API to find files during
  developement -- when the static files haven't been collected in
  ``STATIC_ROOT``.

- Fixed regression with the ``COMPRESS`` setting, pre-compilation and
  staticfiles.

0.6
---

Major improvements and a lot of bugfixes, some of which are:

- New precompilation support, which allows compilation of files and
  hunks with easily configurable compilers before calling the actual
  output filters. See the
  :ref:`COMPRESS_PRECOMPILERS <compress_precompilers>` for more details.

- New staticfiles support. With the introduction of the staticfiles app
  to Django 1.3, compressor officially supports finding the files to
  compress using the app's finder API. Have a look at the documentation
  about :ref:`remote storages <remote_storages>` in case you want to use
  those together with compressor.

- New ``compress`` management command which allows pre-running of what the
  compress template tag does. See the
  :ref:`pre-compression <pre-compression>` docs for more information.

- Various perfomance improvements by better caching and mtime cheking.

- Deprecated ``COMPRESS_LESSC_BINARY`` setting because it's now
  superseded by the :ref:`COMPRESS_PRECOMPILERS <compress_precompilers>`
  setting. Just make sure to use the correct mimetype when linking to less
  files or adding inline code and add the following to your settings::

      COMPRESS_PRECOMPILERS = (
          ('text/less', 'lessc {infile} {outfile}'),
      )

- Added cssmin_ filter (``compressor.filters.CSSMinFilter``) based on
  Zachary Voase's Python port of the YUI CSS compression algorithm.

- Reimplemented the dog-piling prevention.

- Make sure the CssAbsoluteFilter works for relative paths.

- Added inline render mode. See :ref:`usage <usage>` docs.

- Added ``mtime_cache`` management command to add and/or remove all mtimes
  from the cache.

- Moved docs to Read The Docs: http://django_compressor.readthedocs.org

- Added optional ``compressor.storage.GzipCompressorFileStorage`` storage
  backend that gzips of the saved files automatically for easier deployment.

- Reimplemented a few filters on top of the new
  ``compressor.filters.base.CompilerFilter`` to be a bit more DRY.

- Added tox based test configuration, testing on Django 1.1-1.3 and Python
  2.5-2.7.
