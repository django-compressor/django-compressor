v1.3 (03/18/2013)
-----------------

- *Backward incompatible changes*

  -  Dropped support for Python 2.5. Removed ``any`` and ``walk`` compatibility
     functions in ``compressor.utils``.

  - Removed compatibility with some old django setttings:

    - :attr:`~COMPRESS_ROOT` no longer uses ``MEDIA_ROOT`` if ``STATIC_ROOT`` is
      not defined. It expects ``STATIC_ROOT`` to be defined instead.

    - :attr:`~COMPRESS_URL` no longer uses ``MEDIA_URL`` if ``STATIC_URL`` is
      not defined. It expects ``STATIC_URL`` to be defined instead.

    - :attr:`~COMPRESS_CACHE_BACKEND` no longer uses ``CACHE_BACKEND`` and simply
      defaults to ``default``.

- Added precompiler class support. This enables you to write custom precompilers
  with Python logic in them instead of just relying on executables.

- Made CssAbsoluteFilter smarter: it now handles URLs with hash fragments or
  querystring correctly. In addition, it now leaves alone fragment-only URLs.

- Removed a ``fsync()`` call in ``CompilerFilter`` to improve performance.
  We already called ``self.infile.flush()`` so that call was not necessary.

- Added an extension to provide django-sekizai support.
  See :ref:`django-sekizai Support <django-sekizai_support>` for more
  information.

- Fixed a ``DeprecationWarning`` regarding the use of ``django.utils.hashcompat``

- Updated bundled ``rjsmin.py`` to fix some JavaScript compression errors.

v1.2
----

- Added compatibility with Django 1.4 and dropped support for Django 1.2.X.

- Added contributing docs. Be sure to check them out and start contributing!

- Moved CI to Travis: http://travis-ci.org/django-compressor/django-compressor

- Introduced a new ``compressed`` context dictionary that is passed to
  the templates that are responsible for rendering the compressed snippets.

  This is a **backwards-incompatible change** if you've overridden any of
  the included templates:

  - ``compressor/css_file.html``
  - ``compressor/css_inline.html``
  - ``compressor/js_file.html``
  - ``compressor/js_inline.html``

  The variables passed to those templates have been namespaced in a
  dictionary, so it's easy to fix your own templates.

  For example, the old ``compressor/js_file.html``::

    <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ url }}"></script>

  The new ``compressor/js_file.html``::

    <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ compressed.url }}"></script>

- Removed old templates named ``compressor/css.html`` and
  ``compressor/js.html`` that were originally left for backwards
  compatibility. If you've overridden them, just rename them to
  ``compressor/css_file.html`` or ``compressor/js_file.html`` and
  make sure you've accounted for the backwards incompatible change
  of the template context mentioned above.

- Reverted an unfortunate change to the YUI filter that prepended
  ``'java -jar'`` to the binary name, which doesn't alway work, e.g.
  if the YUI compressor is shipped as a script like
  ``/usr/bin/yui-compressor``.

- Changed the sender parameter of the :func:`~compressor.signals.post_compress`
  signal to be either :class:`compressor.css.CssCompressor` or
  :class:`compressor.js.JsCompressor` for easier customization.

- Correctly handle offline compressing files that are found in ``{% if %}``
  template blocks.

- Renamed the second option for the ``COMPRESS_CSS_HASHING_METHOD`` setting
  from ``'hash'`` to ``'content'`` to better describe what it does. The old
  name is also supported, as well as the default being ``'mtime'``.

- Fixed CssAbsoluteFilter, ``src`` attributes in includes now get transformed.

- Added a new hook to allow developers to completely bypass offline
  compression in CompressorNode subclasses: ``is_offline_compression_enabled``.

- Dropped versiontools from required dependencies again.

v1.1.2
------

- Fixed an installation issue related to versiontools.

v1.1.1
------

- Fixed a stupid ImportError bug introduced in 1.1.

- Fixed Jinja2 docs of since ``JINJA2_EXTENSIONS`` expects
  a class, not a module.

- Fixed a Windows bug with regard to file resolving with
  staticfiles finders.

- Stopped a potential memory leak when memoizing the rendered
  output.

- Fixed the integration between staticfiles (e.g. in Django <= 1.3.1)
  and compressor which prevents the collectstatic management command
  to work.

  .. warning::

     Make sure to **remove** the ``path`` method of your custom
     :ref:`remote storage <remote_storages>` class!

v1.1
----

- Made offline compression completely independent from cache (by writing a
  manifest.json file).

  You can now easily run the :ref:`compress <pre-compression>` management
  command locally and transfer the :attr:`~django.conf.settings.COMPRESS_ROOT`
  dir to your server.

- Updated installation instructions to properly mention all dependencies,
  even those internally used.

- Fixed a bug introduced in 1.0 which would prevent the proper deactivation
  of the compression in production.

- Added a Jinja2_ :doc:`contrib extension </jinja2>`.

- Made sure the rel attribute of link tags can be mixed case.

- Avoid overwriting context variables needed for compressor to work.

- Stopped the compress management command to require model validation.

- Added missing imports and fixed a few :pep:`8` issues.

v1.0.1
------

- Fixed regression in ``compressor.utils.staticfiles`` compatibility
  module.

v1.0
----

- **BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE** Stopped swallowing exceptions raised by
  rendering the template tag in production (``DEBUG = False``). This
  has the potential to breaking lots of apps but on the other hand
  will help find bugs.

- **BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE** The default function to create the cache
  key stopped containing the server hostname. Instead the cache key
  now only has the form ``'django_compressor.<KEY>'``.

  To revert to the previous way simply set the ``COMPRESS_CACHE_KEY_FUNCTION``
  to ``'compressor.cache.socket_cachekey'``.

- **BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE** Renamed ambigously named
  ``COMPRESS_DATA_URI_MAX_SIZE`` setting to ``COMPRESS_DATA_URI_MAX_SIZE``.
  It's the maximum size the ``compressor.filters.datauri.DataUriFilter``
  filter will embed files as data: URIs.

- Added ``COMPRESS_CSS_HASHING_METHOD`` setting with the options ``'mtime'``
  (default) and ``'hash'`` for the ``CssAbsoluteFilter`` filter. The latter
  uses the content of the file to calculate the cache-busting hash.

- Added support for ``{{ block.super }}`` to ``compress`` management command.

- Dropped Django 1.1.X support.

- Fixed compiler filters on Windows.

- Handle new-style cached template loaders in the compress management command.

- Documented included filters.

- Added `Slim It`_ filter.

- Added new CallbackOutputFilter to ease the implementation of Python-based
  callback filters that only need to pass the content to a callable.

- Make use of `django-appconf`_ for settings handling and `versiontools`_
  for versions.

- Uses the current context when rendering the render templates.

- Added :func:`post_compress<compressor.signals.post_compress>` signal.

v0.9.2
------

- Fixed stdin handling of precompiler filter.

v0.9.1
------

- Fixed encoding related issue.

- Minor cleanups.

v0.9
----

- Fixed the precompiler support to also use the full file path instead of a
  temporarily created file.

- Enabled test coverage.

- Refactored caching and other utility code.

- Switched from SHA1 to MD5 for hash generation to lower the computational impact.

v0.8
----

- Replace naive jsmin.py with rJSmin (http://opensource.perlig.de/rjsmin/)
  and fixed a few problems with JavaScript comments.

- Fixed converting relative URLs in CSS files when running in debug mode.

.. note::

    If you relied on the ``split_contents`` method of ``Compressor`` classes,
    please make sure a fourth item is returned in the iterable that denotes
    the base name of the file that is compressed.

v0.7.1
------

- Fixed import error when using the standalone django-staticfiles app.

v0.7
----

- Created new parser, HtmlParser, based on the stdlib HTMLParser module.

- Added a new default AutoSelectParser, which picks the LxmlParser if lxml
  is available and falls back to HtmlParser.

- Use unittest2 for testing goodness.

- Fixed YUI JavaScript filter argument handling.

- Updated bundled jsmin to use version by Dave St.Germain that was refactored for speed.

v0.6.4
------

- Fixed Closure filter argument handling.

v0.6.3
------

- Fixed options mangling in CompilerFilter initialization.

- Fixed tox configuration.

- Extended documentation and README.

- In the compress command ignore hidden files when looking for templates.

- Restructured utilities and added staticfiles compat layer.

- Restructered parsers and added a html5lib based parser.

v0.6.2
------

- Minor bugfixes that caused the compression not working reliably in
  development mode (e.g. updated files didn't trigger a new compression).

v0.6.1
------

- Fixed staticfiles support to also use its finder API to find files during
  developement -- when the static files haven't been collected in
  ``STATIC_ROOT``.

- Fixed regression with the ``COMPRESS`` setting, pre-compilation and
  staticfiles.

v0.6
----

Major improvements and a lot of bugfixes, some of which are:

- New precompilation support, which allows compilation of files and
  hunks with easily configurable compilers before calling the actual
  output filters. See the
  :attr:`~django.conf.settings.COMPRESS_PRECOMPILERS` for more details.

- New staticfiles support. With the introduction of the staticfiles app
  to Django 1.3, compressor officially supports finding the files to
  compress using the app's finder API. Have a look at the documentation
  about :ref:`remote storages <remote_storages>` in case you want to use
  those together with compressor.

- New ``compress`` management command which allows pre-running of what the
  compress template tag does. See the
  :ref:`pre-compression <pre-compression>` docs for more information.

- Various perfomance improvements by better caching and mtime cheking.

- Deprecated ``COMPRESS_LESSC_BINARY`` setting because it's now
  superseded by the :attr:`~django.conf.settings.COMPRESS_PRECOMPILERS`
  setting. Just make sure to use the correct mimetype when linking to less
  files or adding inline code and add the following to your settings::

      COMPRESS_PRECOMPILERS = (
          ('text/less', 'lessc {infile} {outfile}'),
      )

- Added cssmin_ filter (``compressor.filters.CSSMinFilter``) based on
  Zachary Voase's Python port of the YUI CSS compression algorithm.

- Reimplemented the dog-piling prevention.

- Make sure the CssAbsoluteFilter works for relative paths.

- Added inline render mode. See :ref:`usage <usage>` docs.

- Added ``mtime_cache`` management command to add and/or remove all mtimes
  from the cache.

- Moved docs to Read The Docs: http://django-compressor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

- Added optional ``compressor.storage.GzipCompressorFileStorage`` storage
  backend that gzips of the saved files automatically for easier deployment.

- Reimplemented a few filters on top of the new
  ``compressor.filters.base.CompilerFilter`` to be a bit more DRY.

- Added tox based test configuration, testing on Django 1.1-1.3 and Python
  2.5-2.7.
