django-sekizai Support
======================

Django Compressor comes with support for _django-sekizai via an extension.
_django-sekizai provides the ability to include template code, from within
any block, to a parent block. It is primarily used to include js/css from
included templates to the master template.

It requires _django-sekizai to installed. Refer to the _django-sekizai _docs
for how to use ``render_block``

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: django

    {% load sekizai_tags %}
    {% render_block "<js/css>" postprocessor "compressor.contrib.sekizai.compress" %}
