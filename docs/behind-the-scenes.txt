Behind the scenes
=================

This document assumes you already have an up and running instance of
Django Compressor, and that you understand how to use it in your templates.
The goal is to explain what the main template tag, {% compress %}, does
behind the scenes, to help you debug performance problems for instance.

First step: Offline cache
-------------------------

The first thing {% compress %} tries to do is get the offline cache for its
nodelist if offline cache is activated. It doesn't parse, doesn't check the
modified times of the files, doesn't even know which files are concerned 
actually, since it doesn't look inside the nodelist of the template block
enclosed by the ``compress`` template tag. The cache should return the HTML
containing the element code for the combined file or piece of code (which,
if the cache key exists, is supposed to already exist on disk/custom storage).

Everything stops here if the cache entry exists.

Second step: parsing and file list
----------------------------------

A compressor instance is created, which in turns instanciates the HTML parser.
The parser is used to determine a file or code hunk list. Each file mtime is
checked, first in cache and then on disk/storage, and this is used to
determine an unique cache key.

Third step: Checking the "main" cache
-------------------------------------

Compressor checks if it can get some info about the combined file/hunks
corresponding to its instance, using the cache key obtained in the previous
step. The cache content here will actually be the HTML containing the final
element code, just like in the offline step before. 

Everything stops here if the cache entry exists.

Fourth step: Generating the combined file if needed
---------------------------------------------------

The file is generated if necessary. All precompilers are called and all
filters are executed, and a hash is determined from the contents. This in
turns helps determine the file name, which is only saved if it didn't exist
already. Then the HTML output is returned (and also saved in the cache).
And that's it!
